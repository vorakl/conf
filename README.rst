The configuration of my workstation
###################################

This repository represents a software configuration of my workstation.
It's simple, fast and pretty functional. It really helps to focus on ``what`` I do rather than ``where`` I do it.
Basically, my working environment is built around `Fedora Linux`_ and `i3 window manager`_. 
I'm actively using console tools such as `Midnight Commander`_ for managing files and Vim_ for editing.
Most of the time I work in a command line of Bash_ over tmux_ (in case of a remote connection) or Tilix_ (if it's a local system)

Each component resides in a separate directory with all needed configuration files, documentation and the installation script.
