# My working environment

### The basis

My working environment is built around i3 window manager which is pretty functional, 
fast and simple. It really helps to focus on what you do rather than where you do it. 
So, the most important parts are  

* Linux Fedora
* i3 window manager
* bash
* tmux
* mc
* vim

Open a particular directory for details

### Useful tools for everyday usage

* tig (Git repo manager)
* jq (JSON parser)
* tomastomecek/sen (TUI for docker engine)
* ps_mem (Details about memory utilisation)
* apg (Password generator)
* htop (process viewer)
* dstat (system resource statistics)
